# To-do
    - Filter produced images according to nodata / delete detected files by code
    - Filter produced images by including points / done!
    - Filter useless images (black rows)

# GDAL is necessary!

# To find out
    - Can one filter an image

# Interesting stuff

Pixelsize: 27.8 x 27.8 m, average diameter of a tell: ~100m

# Approaches
    - Identification via hillshade
    - Coloring the corresponding ground

# Problems / goals
    - More than one tell per picture
    - Get the center coordinate of a potential finding
    - Some tells are laying on 'dark' areas, other approaches?
